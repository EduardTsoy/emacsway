About
-----

Bearded developer since 2004. I'm an adherent of `KISS principle <KISS_>`_. My philosophy is: «Shorter», «clearly».


Preferences
-----------

* Programming languages: Python (mainly, since 2008), JavaScript (strong), Ruby (sometimes),  PHP (in the past).
* Development environment: Emacs (sometimes VIM).
* DB & storages: MySQL, Spatial, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, tsearch2, MongoDB, Redis, Memcached, replication, sharding, analysing, SQL optimization.
* Frameworks: Django (mainly), Tornado, Flask, Twisted, Pyramid, Werkzeug, CherryPy, Ruby on Rails, etc.
* JavaScript Frameworks: Dojo, jQuery.
* OS: Debian (server), ArchLinux (desktop, server), Ubuntu (desktop, server), Fedora (desktop, server).
* Bug-tracking: Trac (mainly), Redmine, Pivotal Tracker.
* HTTP servers: Nginx (mainly), Apache2, Lighttpd, Unicorn.
* CVS: Mercurial (mainly), GIT, SVN, Bazar.
* Others: Eventlet, GDB, Celery, geographic information system (GIS), Storm ORM, multiprocessing, threading, queue, async, Solr, morphology, Pinax, Design Patterns, refactoring, business-transactions, high-load, high level concurrency, Remote Facade, DTO, cache invalidation based on tagging, AOT, ACL, social networks integration, KISS principle.
* Also, I've a good (5+ years) experience with PHP, Zend Framework, Drupal, but it, mainly, in the past (2004-2009).

P.S.
----

    "The design goal for Eventlet’s API is simplicity and readability. You should be able to read its code and understand what it’s doing. Fewer lines of code are preferred over excessively clever implementations." (`Eventlet’s docs <http://eventlet.net/doc/basic_usage.html>`__)

    "I like my code to be elegant and efficient. The logic should be straightforward to make it hard for bugs to hide, the dependencies minimal to ease maintenance, error handling complete according to an articulated strategy, and performance close to optimal so as not to tempt people to make the code messy with unprincipled optimizations. Clean code does one thing well." (Bjarne Stroustrup, inventor of C++ and author of The C++ Programming Language.)

    "Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability." (Edsger W. Dijkstra)

    "Simplicity and elegance are unpopular because they require hard work and discipline to achieve and education to be appreciated." (Edsger W. Dijkstra)

    "Simplicity is a great virtue but it requires hard work to achieve it and education to appreciate it. And to make matters worse: complexity sells better." (Edsger W. Dijkstra, 1984 `On the nature of Computing Science <http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD08xx/EWD896.html>`__ (EWD896))

    "A little time spent refactoring can make the code better communicate its purpose. Programming in this mode is all about saying exactly what you mean." ("Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code", Martin Fowler)

    "Clean code - is ability of code to express the truth about itself, and not misleading."
